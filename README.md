# OpenMesh

The marketplace for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Discover, pay, and use AI tools in milliseconds.

## The Problem

MCP servers are revolutionizing how AI agents access tools and data. But they're missing two critical pieces: **discovery** and **monetization**.

Today: Manually configure each MCP server. No way to find new ones. No way for creators to get paid.

OpenMesh fixes thisâ€”any agent discovers any MCP server, pays instantly with x402, and gets to work.

## How It Works

```bash
# 1. Add OpenMesh to your MCP server
$ npx openmesh init --mcp
âœ“ Generated manifest.yaml for MCP server
âœ“ Auto-discovered 5 tools from your server

# 2. Publish to the registry
$ npx openmesh publish
âœ“ MCP server registered
âœ“ Tools indexed and searchable
âœ“ Live at https://registry.openmesh.dev/your-server

# 3. Enable payments (optional)
$ npx openmesh enable x402
âœ“ Payment middleware added
âœ“ Each tool call now costs 0.001 USDC
```

## What This Enables

**For AI Agents**:
- Discover MCP tools across the entire ecosystem
- Pay per use with x402 (no API keys!)
- Switch providers instantly based on price/performance

**For MCP Developers**:
- Monetize your MCP server with one command
- Get discovered by thousands of AI agents
- Focus on building tools, not payment infrastructure

**For the Ecosystem**:
- Anthropic's MCP handles tool standardization
- OpenMesh adds discovery and payments
- Together: a complete AI tool economy

## Project Status

### Current (v0.1-draft):
- âœ… Manifest specification drafted
- âœ… CLI architecture designed  
- âœ… Example implementations sketched
- ðŸš§ Registry protocol in design
- ðŸš§ x402 integration planned

### Not Yet Built:
- Actual CLI implementation
- Registry infrastructure
- Payment verification
- Production deployments

## Quick Start (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g openmesh

# For MCP server developers
openmesh init --mcp              # Create manifest from MCP server
openmesh validate                 # Test your MCP endpoints
openmesh publish                  # Add to registry

# For AI agents/developers
openmesh discover "code analysis" # Find MCP tools
openmesh test <server-name>       # Try before integrating
```

## Specification

See [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the complete manifest format.

## Contributing

This is a community project under SCULPT. We need:

- **MCP Integration**: Help us support more MCP features
- **CLI Development**: TypeScript implementation using MCP SDK
- **Registry Design**: How should MCP server discovery work?
- **Example Servers**: Build MCP servers with OpenMesh payments
- **Client Libraries**: Integrate OpenMesh into AI frameworks

Join the discussion:
- **Discord**: [discord.gg/sculpt](https://discord.gg/sculpt) â†’ #openmesh
- **GitHub Issues**: Design decisions, proposals, questions

## Philosophy

- **MCP-native**: Built on Anthropic's Model Context Protocol
- **Open by default**: Apache-2 spec, MIT CLI, CC-BY registry data
- **No lock-in**: Your MCP server, your rules
- **Payments optional**: Free tools stay free, paid tools get rails
- **Agent-first**: Built for AI, not humans

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MCP Discovery (Current)
- Manifest spec for MCP servers
- CLI for MCP server registration
- Basic registry with tool search

### Phase 2: Payment Layer (Next)
- x402 middleware for MCP
- Per-tool pricing configuration
- Payment verification system

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Growth (Future)
- Claude Desktop integration
- LangChain/AutoGen plugins
- Decentralized registry
- Advanced analytics
